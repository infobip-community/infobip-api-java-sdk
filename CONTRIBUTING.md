## Submitting an Issue

If you've seen something that is or might seem like a bug or a mistake in the
documentation, or you simply have a suggestion for a new feature, please go
ahead and open us [an issue][issue-link]. Include as much information as 
you have.

Before you submit your issue please do the archive search first, maybe the
same question was already answered or is pending.

If you did not find a related issue among the ones already asked, feel free
to open a new issue.

For new feature requests, feel free not to follow to the letter the following
structure. However, for any sort of bug, anomaly, issue etc. type of request,
please do refer to provided structure. It might save us a lot of time to
pinpoint and fix what is the subject of the issue in less time.

### New issue structure (bugs, anomalies, improvements...)

Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue
being dealt with quickly:

* **Short TO-THE-POINT Overview** - what seems to be the issue
* **Description** - more detailed explanation of the issue. The stack trace
in cases where it is applicable.
* **Which `infobip-api-java-sdk` version(s)** - which library version(s)
did you used when occurred with this issue.
* **Which `JRE` version(s)** - which Java Runtime Environment version(s)
did you used when occurred with this issue.
* **Environment** - is this a problem with all development/testing/production
environments or only specific one(s)?
* **Reproducing** - how did it happen? Is it an isolated anomaly, can you
reproduce it, what are the steps to reproduce it?
* **Related Issues** - is there something similar to this issue that has been
reported before? If so, please tag that issue(s) as a reference.

the part of the code that might be causing the bug.

## Pull Requests

We'll gladly accept your pull requests, but they should be easily understood,
short and follow the pre-existing conventions so that everyone involved can
understand what you're trying to do. Feel free to open an issue first (check
above on how to do that) and indulge your fellow developers in some
discussion.We appreciate your effort and time so please always check whether 
there are previously opened (or even closed) pull requests related to your 
topic of interest.

When you're ready to start coding, fork this repository to your own GitHub
account and make your changes in a new branch. We strongly recommend you use
single-change commits. Once you feel it's ready, open us a pull request and
explain what the change is so we can evaluate the impact and importance it
may have on project.
